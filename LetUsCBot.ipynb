It was designed and written by a man named Dennis Ritchie. In the late  \\nseventies C began to replace the more familiar languages of that time like PL/I,  \\nALGOL, etc\\n          ANSI C standard emerged in the early 1980s, this book was split into two \\ntitles: The original was still called Programming in C , and the title that covered  \\nANSI C was called Programming in ANSI C . This was done because it took  \\nseveral years for the compiler vendors to release their ANSI C compilers and for  \\nthem to become ubiquitous.  It was initially designed for programming UNIX  \\noperating system.  Now the software tool as well as the C compiler is written in C.  \\nMajor parts of popular operating systems like Windows, UNIX,  Linux is still  \\nwritten in C. This is because even today when it comes to performance (speed of  \\nexecution) nothing beats C. Moreover, if one is to extend the operating system to  \\nwork with new devices one needs to write device driver programs. These  \\nprograms are exclusively written in C . C seems so popular is because it is reliable, \\nsimple and easy to use.  often heard today is – “C has been already superceded  \\nby languages like C++, C# and Java .   \\nProgram\\n                                                                                   5                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        There is a close analogy between learning English language and learning C  \\nlanguage. The classical method of learning English is to first learn the alphabets  \\nused in the language, then learn to combine these alphabets to form words, which  \\nin turn are combined to form sentences and sentences are combined to form  \\nparagraphs. Learning C is similar and easier. Instead of straight-away learning how  \\nto write programs, we must first know what alphabets, numbers and special  \\nsymbols are used in C, then how using them constants, variables and keywords are  \\nconstructed, and finally how are these combined to form an  instruction. A group \\nof instructions would be combined later on to form a program. So\\n    a computer program is just a collection of the instructions necessary to solve a  \\nspecific problem. The basic operations of a computer system form what is known  \\nas the computer’s instruction set. And the approach or method that is used to solve  \\nthe problem is known as an algorithm.\\nSo for as programming language concern these are of two types.\\n      1) Low level language\\n      2) High level language\\nLow level language:\\n                                                                                   6                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                             Low level languages are machine level and assembly level language . In \\nmachine level language computer only understand digital numbers i.e. in the form  \\nof 0 and 1. So, instruction given to the computer is in the form binary digit, which  \\nis difficult to implement instruction in binary code. This type of program is not  \\nportable, difficult to maintain and also error prone. The assembly language  is on \\nother hand modified version of machine level language. Where instructions are  \\ngiven in English like word as ADD, SUM, MOV etc. It is easy to write and  \\nunderstand but not understand by the machine. So the translator used here is  \\nassembler to translate into machine level. Although language is bit easier,  \\nprogrammer has to know low level details related to low level language. In the  \\nassembly level language the data are stored in the computer register, which varies  \\nfor different computer. Hence it is not portable. \\nHigh level language:\\n    These languages are machine independent, means it is portable. The language in  \\nthis category is Pascal, Cobol, Fortran etc. High level languages are understood by  \\nthe machine. So it need to translate by the translator into machine level. A  \\ntranslator is software which is used to translate high level language as well as low  \\nlevel language in to machine level language.\\n        Three types of translator are there:\\nCompiler\\nInterpreter \\nAssembler\\n  Compiler and interpreter are used to convert the high level language into machine  \\nlevel language. The program written in high level language is known as source  \\nprogram and the corresponding machine level language program is called as object  \\nprogram. Both compiler and interpreter perform the same task but there working is  \\ndifferent. Compiler read the program at-a-time and searches the error and lists  \\nthem. If the program is error free then it is converted into object program. When  \\nprogram size is large then compiler is preferred. Whereas interpreter read only one  \\nline of the source code and convert it to object code. If  it check error, statement by  \\nstatement and hence of take more time. \\n                                                                                   7                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Integrated Development Environments  (IDE)\\nThe process of editing, compiling, running, and debugging programs is often  \\nmanaged by a single integrated application known as an Integrated Development  \\nEnvironment, or IDE for short. An IDE is a windows-based program that allows us  \\nto easily manage large software programs, edit  files in windows, and compile, link,  \\nrun, and debug programs.\\nOn Mac OS X, CodeWarrior and Xcode are two IDEs that are used by many  \\nprogrammers. Under Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio is a good example of a  \\npopular IDE. Kylix is a popular IDE for developing applications under Linux.  \\nMost IDEs also support program development in several different programming  \\nlanguages in addition to C, such as C# and C++. \\n                                                                                   8                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                                                                            Lecture Note: 2\\nStructure of  C Language program\\n1 ) Comment line\\n2)  Preprocessor directive\\n3 )  Global variable declaration\\n4)  main function( )\\n                {\\n                   Local variables;\\n   Statements;\\n   }\\n   User defined function\\n  }\\n}\\nComment line\\nIt indicates the purpose of the program. It is represented as\\n/*……………………………..*/ \\nComment line is used for increasing the readability of the program. It is useful in  \\nexplaining the program and generally used for documentation.

It is also used in symbolic constant such as #define PI  \\n3.14(value).

Figure below shows the steps that are involved in  \\nentering, compiling, and executing a\\ncomputer program developed in the C programming language and the typical Unix  \\ncommands that would be entered from the command line. \\n    Step 1:  The program that is to be compiled is first typed into a file on the \\ncomputer system.    There are various conventions that are used for naming files,  \\ntypically be any name provided the last two characters are “.c” or  file with \\nextension .c. So, the file name prog1.c  might be a valid filename for a C program.  \\nA text editor is usually used to enter the C program into a file. For example, vi is a  \\npopular text editor used on Unix systems. The program that is entered into the file  \\nis known as the source program  because it represents the original form of the  \\nprogram expressed in the C language. \\nStep 2:  After the source program has been entered into a file, then proceed to have  \\nit compiled. The compilation process is initiated by typing a special command on  \\nthe system. When this command is entered, the name of the file that contains the  \\nsource program must also be specified. For example, under Unix, the command to  \\ninitiate program compilation is called cc. If  we are using the popular GNU C  \\ncompiler, the command we use is gcc.\\n              Typing the line\\n                        gcc prog1.c or cc prog1.c\\nIn the first step of the compilation process, the compiler examines each program\\nstatement contained in the source program and checks it to ensure that it conforms  \\nto the syntax and semantics of the language. If any mistakes are discovered by the  \\ncompiler during this phase, they are reported to the user and the compilation  \\nprocess ends right there. The errors then have to be corrected in the source program  \\n(with the use of an editor), and the compilation process must be restarted. Typical  \\nerrors reported during this phase of compilation might be due to an expression that  \\nhas unbalanced parentheses ( syntactic error), or due to the use of a variable that is  \\nnot “defined” (semantic error).\\n                                                                                   12                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Step 3:  When all the syntactic and semantic errors have been removed from the  \\nprogram, the compiler then proceeds to take each statement of the program and  \\ntranslate it into a “lower” form that is equivalent to assembly language program  \\nneeded to perform the identical task.\\nStep 4:  After the program has been translated the next step in the compilation  \\nprocess is to translate the assembly language statements into actual machine  \\ninstructions. The assembler takes each assembly language statement and converts it  \\ninto a binary format known as object code, which is then written into another file  \\non the system. This file has the same name as the source file under Unix, with the  \\nlast letter an “o” (for object) instead of a “c”. \\nStep 5:  After the program has been translated into object code, it is ready to be  \\nlinked. This process is once again performed automatically whenever the cc or gcc  \\ncommand is issued under Unix. The purpose of the linking phase is to get the  \\nprogram into a final form for execution on the computer.\\n                           If the program uses other programs that were previously  \\nprocessed by the compiler, then during this phase the programs are linked together.  \\nPrograms that are used from the system’s program library are also searched and  \\nlinked together with the object program during this phase.\\nThe process of compiling and linking a program is often called building.\\nThe final linked file, which is in an executable object code format, is stored in  \\nanother file on the system, ready to be run or executed. Under Unix, this file is  \\ncalled a.out by default. Under Windows, the executable file usually has the same  \\nname as the source file, with the c extension replaced by an exe extension.\\n                                                                                   13                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Step 6:  To subsequently execute the program, the command a.out has the effect \\nof loading the program called a.out into the computer’s memory and initiating its  \\nexecution.\\nWhen the program is executed, each of the statements of the program is  \\nsequentially executed in turn. If the program requests any data from the user,  \\nknown as input, the program temporarily suspends its execution so that the input  \\ncan be entered. Or, the program might simply wait for an event, such as a mouse  \\nbeing clicked, to occur. Results that are displayed by the program, known as  \\noutput, appear in a window, sometimes called the console. If the program does not  \\nproduce the desired results, it is necessary to go back and reanalyze the program’s  \\nlogic.

These words are predefined and always  \\nwritten in lower case or small letter. These keywords cann’t be used as a variable  \\nname as it assigned with fixed meaning. Some examples are int, short, signed,  \\nunsigned, default, volatile, float, long, double, break, continue, typedef, static,  \\ndo, for,  union, return, while, do, extern, register, enum,  case,  goto,  struct,  \\nchar, auto, const etc.   \\n            \\n       \\n  data types\\nData types refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of  \\ndifferent types before its use. The type of a variable determines how much space it  \\noccupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted. The value of a \\nvariable can be changed any time.\\nC has the following  4 types of data types\\nbasic built-in data types : int, float, double, char\\nEnumeration data type:  enum\\nDerived data type : pointer, array, structure, union\\nVoid data type: void\\n         A variable declared to be of type int can be used to contain integral values  \\nonly—that is, values that do not contain decimal places.  A variable declared to be  \\nof type float can be used for storing floating- point numbers (values containing  \\ndecimal places). The double type is the same as type float, only with roughly twice  \\nthe precision. The char data type can be used to store a single character, such as the  \\nletter a, the digit character 6, or a semicolon similarly A variable declared char can  \\nonly store character type value. \\nThere are two types of  type qualifier in c\\n     Size qualifier: short, long\\nSign qualifier: signed, unsigned\\n                                                                                   19                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                         When the qualifier unsigned is used the number is always positive, and when  \\nsigned is used number may be positive or negative. If the sign qualifier is not  \\nmentioned, then by default sign qualifier is assumed. The range of values for  \\nsigned data types is less than that of unsigned data type. Because in signed type,  \\nthe left most bit is used to represent sign, while in unsigned type this bit is also  \\nused to represent the value. The size and range of the different data types on a 16  \\nbit machine is given below:\\nBasic data type Data type with type\\nqualifier Size\\n(byte)Range\\nchar char or signed char\\nUnsigned char1\\n1-128 to 127\\n0 to 255\\nint int or signed int\\nunsigned int\\nshort int or signed short int\\nunsigned short int\\nlong int or signed long int\\nunsigned long int 2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n4\\n4-32768 to 32767 \\n0 to 65535\\n-128 to 127\\n0 to 255\\n-2147483648 to 2147483647\\n0 to 4294967295 \\nfloat float 4-3.4E-38 to 3.4E+38\\ndouble double\\nLong double8\\n101.7E-308 to 1.7E+308\\n3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932\\n                                                                                   20                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                                                                                                                     Lecture Note: 4\\n Constants \\n  \\nConstant is a any value that cannot be changed during program execution. In C, \\nany number, single character, or character string is known as a constant. A constant \\nis an entity that doesn’t change whereas a variable is an entity that may change.  \\nFor example, the number 50 represents a constant integer value. The character  \\nstring \"Programming in C is fun.\\\\n\" is an example of a constant character string.  C \\nconstants can be divided into two major categories: \\nPrimary Constants \\nSecondary Constants \\nThese constants are further categorized as \\n             Numeric constant\\n              Character constant\\n              String constant\\n                                                                                   21                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Numeric constant : Numeric constant consists of digits. It required minimum size  \\nof 2 bytes and max 4 bytes. It may be positive or negative but by default sign is  \\nalways positive. No comma or space is allowed within the numeric constant and it  \\nmust have at least 1 digit. The allowable range for integer constants is -32768 to  \\n32767. Truly speaking the range of an Integer constant depends upon the compiler.  \\nFor a 16-bit compiler like Turbo C or Turbo C++ the range is –32768 to 32767.  \\nFor a 32-bit compiler the range would be even greater.  Mean by a 16-bit or a 32-\\nbit compiler, what range of an Integer constant has to do with the type of compiler.  \\nIt is categorized a integer constant  and real constant.  An integer  constants are  \\nwhole number which have no decimal point. Types of integer constants are:\\n      Decimal constant:           0-------9(base 10)  \\n      Octal constant:                0-------7(base 8)\\n      Hexa decimal  constant:  0----9, A------F(base 16) \\n     In decimal constant first digit should not be zero unlike octal constant first digit  \\nmust be zero(as 076, 0127) and in hexadecimal constant first two digit should be  \\n0x/ 0X (such as 0x24, 0x87A). By default type of integer constant is integer but if  \\nthe value of integer constant is exceeds range then value represented by integer  \\ntype is taken to be unsigned integer or long integer. It can also be explicitly  \\nmention integer and unsigned integer type by suffix l/L and u/U. \\nReal constant is also called floating point constant. To construct real constant we  \\nmust follow the rule of , \\n  -real constant must have at least one digit. \\n -It must have a decimal point. \\n  -It could be either positive or negative. \\n -Default sign is positive. \\n   -No commas or blanks are allowed within a real constant. Ex.: +325.34 \\n426.0 \\n-32.76 \\nTo express small/large real constant exponent(scientific) form is used where  \\nnumber is written in mantissa and exponent form separated by e/E. Exponent can  \\nbe positive or negative integer but mantissa can  be real/integer type, for example  \\n3.6*105=3.6e+5. By default type of floating point constant is double, it can also be  \\nexplicitly defined it by suffix of f/F.\\nCharacter constant\\n                                                                                   22                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                         Character constant represented as a single character enclosed within a single  \\nquote. These can be single digit, single special symbol or white spaces such as  \\n‘9’,’c’,’$’, ‘ ’ etc. Every character constant has a unique integer like value in  \\nmachine’s character code as if machine using ASCII (American standard code for  \\ninformation interchange). Some numeric value associated with each upper and  \\nlower case alphabets and decimal integers are as:\\n                    A------------ Z ASCII value (65-90)\\n                     a-------------z ASCII value (97-122)\\n                     0-------------9   ASCII value (48-59)\\n                       ;                      ASCII value (59) \\n              String constant\\n        Set of characters are called string and when sequence of characters are  \\nenclosed within a double quote (it may be combination of all kind of symbols) is a  \\nstring constant. String constant has zero, one or more than one character and at the  \\nend of the string null character(\\\\0) is automatically placed by compiler. Some  \\nexamples are “,sarathina” , “908”, “3”,” ”, “A” etc. In C although same characters  \\nare enclosed within single and double quotes it represents different meaning such  \\nas “A” and ‘A’ are different because first one is string attached with null character  \\nat the end but second one is character constant with its corresponding ASCII value  \\nis 65.\\nSymbolic constant\\nSymbolic constant is a name that substitute for a sequence of characters and,  \\ncharacters may be numeric, character or string constant. These constant are  \\ngenerally defined at the beginning of the program as \\n                                        #define name value ,  here name generally written in  \\nupper case for example                        \\n                                                                                   23                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                                                            #define MAX 10\\n                                    #define CH ‘b’\\n                                      #define NAME “sony”\\n                                               \\n                                                                       \\n             Variables\\nVariable is a data name which is used to store some data value or symbolic names  \\nfor storing program\\ncomputations and results .

But if i were declared to be an integer variable, the expression\\n180 + 2 – j\\nwould not represent a constant expression.\\n       \\n Operator\\nThis is a symbol use to perform some operation on variables, operands or with the  \\nconstant. Some operator required 2 operand to perform operation or Some  \\nrequired single  operation.\\nSeveral operators are there those are, arithmetic operator, assignment,  increment ,  \\ndecrement, logical, conditional, comma, size of , bitwise and others.  \\n 1.  Arithmatic Operator\\nThis operator used for numeric calculation. These are of either Unary arithmetic  \\noperator, Binary arithmetic operator. Where Unary arithmetic operator required  \\n                                                                                   25                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        only one operand such as +,-, ++, --,!, tiled. And these operators are addition,  \\nsubtraction, multiplication, division. Binary arithmetic operator on other hand  \\nrequired two operand and its operators are +(addition), -(subtraction),  \\n*(multiplication), /(division), %(modulus). But modulus cannot applied with  \\nfloating point operand as well as there are no exponent operator in c.\\nUnary (+) and Unary (-) is different from addition and subtraction.\\nWhen both the operand are integer then it is called integer arithmetic and the result  \\nis always integer. When both the operand are floating point then it is called floating  \\narithmetic and when operand is of integer and floating point then it is called mix  \\ntype or mixed mode arithmetic . And the result is in float type.\\n                      2.Assignment Operator  \\nA value can be stored in a variable with the use of assignment operator. The  \\nassignment operator(=) is used in assignment statement and assignment expression.  \\nOperand on the left hand side should be variable and the operand on the right hand  \\nside should be variable or constant or any expression. When variable on the left  \\nhand side is occur on the right hand side then we can avoid by writing the  \\ncompound statement. For example, \\n            int x= y;\\n          int  Sum=x+y+z;\\n                3.Increment and Decrement \\nThe Unary operator ++, --, is used as increment and decrement which acts upon  \\nsingle operand. Increment operator increases the value of variable by one  \\n.Similarly decrement operator decrease the value of the variable by one. And these  \\noperator can only used with the variable, but cann\\'t   use with expression and  \\nconstant as ++6 or ++(x+y+z).\\n                                                                                   26                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        It again categories into prefix post fix . In the prefix the value of the variable is  \\nincremented 1st, then the new value is used, where as in postfix the operator is  \\nwritten after the operand(such as m++,m--).\\nEXAMPLE\\nlet y=12;\\nz= ++y;\\ny= y+1;\\nz= y;\\nSimilarly in the postfix increment and decrement operator is used in the operation .  \\nAnd then increment and decrement is perform.\\nEXAMPLE\\nlet x= 5;\\ny= x++;\\ny=x;\\nx= x+1;\\n                                                                                                                                                                 \\n 4.Relational Operator \\nIt is use to compared value of two expressions depending on their relation.  \\nExpression that contain relational operator is called relational expression.\\nHere the value is assign according to true or false value.\\na.(a>=b) || (b>20)\\nb.(b>a) && (e>b)\\nc. 0(b!=7)\\n    5. Conditional Operator \\n                                                                                   27                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        It sometimes called as ternary operator. Since it  required three expressions  as  \\noperand and it is represented as (? , :).\\nSYNTAX   \\nexp1 ? exp2 :exp3\\nHere  exp1 is first evaluated. It is true then value return will be exp2 . If false then  \\nexp3.\\nEXAMPLE  \\nvoid main()\\n{\\n int a=10, b=2\\n  int s= (a>b) ? a:b;\\n  printf(“value is:%d”);\\n }\\nOutput:\\n    Value is:10\\n 6. Comma Operator\\n Comma operator is use to permit different expression to be appear in a situation  \\nwhere only one expression would be used. All the expression are separator by  \\ncomma and are evaluated from left to right.\\nEXAMPLE \\nint  i, j, k, l;\\nfor(i=1,j=2;i<=5;j<=10;i++;j++)\\n                                                                                   28                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                          7. Sizeof Operator\\nSize of operator is a Unary operator, which gives size of operand in terms of byte  \\nthat occupied in the memory. An operand may be variable, constant or  data  type  \\nqualifier.\\nGenerally it is used make portable program(program that can be run on different  \\nmachine) . It determines the length of entities, arrays and structures when their size  \\nare not known to the programmer. It is also use to allocate size of memory  \\ndynamically during execution of the program.\\nEXAMPLE  \\nmain( )\\n{\\nint sum;\\nfloat f;\\nprintf( \"%d%d\" ,size of(f), size of (sum) );\\nprintf(\"%d%d\", size of(235 L), size of(A));\\n}\\n                                                                                   29                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                                                                                                                          Lecture Note: 6\\n8. Bitwise Operator\\nBitwise operator permit programmer to access and manipulate of data at bit level.  \\nVarious bitwise operator enlisted are\\n one\\'s complement                (~)\\nbitwise   AND                      (&)\\nbitwise OR                            (|)\\n bitwise XOR                        (^)\\nleft shift                                (<<)\\nright shift                              (>>)\\nThese operator can operate on integer and character value but not on float and  \\ndouble. In bitwise operator the function showbits( )  function is used to display the  \\nbinary representation of any integer or character value.\\nIn one\\'s complement all 0 changes to 1 and all 1 changes to 0. In the bitwise OR its  \\nvalue would obtaining by 0 to 2 bits.\\nAs the bitwise OR operator is used to set on a particular bit in a number. Bitwise  \\nAND the logical AND.\\nIt operate on 2operands and operands are compared on bit by bit basic. And hence  \\nboth the operands are of same type.   \\nLogical  or  Boolean Operator\\nOperator used with one or more operand and return either value zero (for false) or  \\none (for true). The operand may be constant, variables or expressions. And the  \\nexpression that combines two or more expressions is termed as logical expression.\\nC has three logical operators : \\n                                                                                   30                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                            Operator                   Meaning\\n       &&                         AND\\n          ||                           OR\\n           !                            NOT\\nWhere logical NOT is a unary operator and other two are binary operator. Logical  \\nAND gives result true if both the conditions are true, otherwise result is false.  And  \\nlogial OR gives result false if both the condition false, otherwise result is true. \\nPrecedence and associativity of operators\\nOperators          Description             Precedence level        Associativity\\n()                    function call                        1                        left to right  \\n[]                   array subscript   \\n   \\n\\uf0e0                   arrow operator\\n.                      dot operator\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n+                      unary plus                           2                    right to left\\n -                      unary minus\\n++                   increment    \\n   - -                 decrement   \\n!                       logical not\\n~                      1’s complement   \\n*                       indirection  \\n&                       address       \\n(data type)        type cast\\nsizeof                size in byte\\n *                        multiplication                   3                       left to right\\n/                          division  \\n%                       modulus\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n+                         addition                            4                      left to right                    \\n                                                                                   31                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                         -                         subtraction\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n<<                      left shift                             5                      left to right\\n>>                      right shift \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n<=                 less than equal to                6                           left to right\\n>=                 greater than equal to    \\n<                    less than \\n >                  greater than\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n==                 equal to                               7                            left to right\\n!=                  not equal to\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n&                   bitwise AND                      8                             left to right \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n^                    bitwise XOR                       9                             left to right\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n|                       bitwise OR                         10                          left to right\\n&&                  logical AND                      11\\n||                       logical OR                          12\\n?:                     conditional  operator          13\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n=,  *=,  /=, %=      assignment operator      14                         right to left\\n&=, ^=, <<=\\n>>=\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n,                          comma operator                 15      \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                    Lecture Note: 7\\n                      Control   Statement\\n          Generally C program statement is executed in a order in which they appear  \\nin the program. But sometimes we use decision making condition for execution  \\nonly a part of program, that is called control statement. Control statement defined  \\n                                                                                   32                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        how the control is transferred from one part to the other part of the program. There  \\nare several control statement like   if...else, switch, while, do....while, for loop,  \\nbreak, continue, goto etc. \\nLoops in C\\nLoop:-it is a block of statement that performs set of instructions. In loops\\nRepeating particular portion of the program either a specified number of time or  \\nuntil a particular no of condition is being satisfied.\\nThere are three types of loops in c \\n1.While loop\\n2.do while loop\\n3.for loop \\nWhile loop\\nSyntax:-\\nwhile(condition)\\n{\\nStatement 1;\\nStatement 2;\\n}\\nOrwhile(test condition)\\nStatement;\\n                                                                                   33                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        The test condition may be any expression .when we want to do something a fixed  \\nno of times but not known about the number of iteration, in a program then while  \\nloop is used.\\nHere first condition is checked if,   it is true body of the loop is executed else, If  \\ncondition is false control will be come out of loop.\\nExample:-\\n/* wap to print 5 times welcome to C” */\\n#include<stdio.h>\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nint p=1;\\nWhile(p<=5)\\n{\\nprintf(“Welcome to C\\\\n”);\\nP=p+1;\\n}\\n}\\nOutput:  Welcome to C\\n                 Welcome to C\\n                   Welcome to C\\n                  Welcome to C\\n                Welcome to C\\n                                                                                   34                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        So as long as condition remains true statements within the body of while loop will  \\nget executed  repeatedly.\\ndo while loop\\nThis (do while loop) statement is also used for looping. The body of this loop may  \\ncontain single statement or block of statement. The syntax for writing this  \\nstatement is:\\nSyntax:-\\nDo\\n{\\nStatement;\\n}\\nwhile(condition);\\nExample:-\\n#include<stdio.h>\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nint X=4;\\n do\\n{\\n Printf(“%d”,X);\\nX=X+1;\\n                                                                                   35                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                          }whie(X<=10);\\n    Printf(“ ”);\\n}\\nOutput: 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n   Here firstly statement inside body is executed then condition is checked. If the  \\ncondition is true again body of   loop is executed and this process continue until the  \\ncondition becomes false. Unlike while loop semicolon is placed at the end of  \\nwhile.\\n  There is minor difference between while and do while loop, while loop test the  \\ncondition before executing any of the statement of loop. Whereas do while loop  \\ntest condition after having executed the statement at least one within the loop.\\nIf initial condition is false while loop would not executed it’s statement on other  \\nhand  do while loop executed it’s statement at least once even If condition fails for  \\nfirst time. It means  do while loop  always executes at least once. Notes:\\nDo while loop used rarely when we want to execute a loop at least once.\\n                 Lecture Note: 8\\nfor loop \\n In a program,  for loop is generally used when number of iteration are known in  \\nadvance.  The body of the loop can be single statement or multiple statements. Its  \\nsyntax for writing is:\\nSyntax:-\\n                                                                                   36                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        for(exp1;exp2;exp3)\\n{\\nStatement;\\n}\\nOr \\nfor(initialized counter; test counter; update counter)\\n{\\nStatement;\\n}\\nHere exp1 is an initialization expression, exp2 is test expression or condition and  \\nexp3 is an update expression. Expression 1 is executed only once when loop  \\nstarted and used to initialize the loop variables. Condition expression generally  \\nuses relational and logical operators. And updation part executed only when after  \\nbody of the loop is executed.\\nExample:-\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nint i;\\nfor(i=1;i<10;i++)\\n{\\n                                                                                   37                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                         Printf(“ %d ”, i);\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput:-1  2  3   4  5  6  7  8  9\\nNesting of loop\\nWhen a loop written inside the body of another loop then,  it is known as nesting of  \\nloop. Any type of loop can be nested in any type such as while, do while, for. For  \\nexample nesting of for loop can be represented as :\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nint i,j;\\nfor(i=0;i<2;i++)\\n for(j=0;j<5; j++)\\nprintf(“%d %d”, i, j);\\n }\\nOutput: i=0\\n      j=0 1 2 3 4\\n       i=1\\n      j=0 1 2 3 4\\n                                                                                   38                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Break statement(break)\\n   Sometimes it becomes necessary to come out of the loop even before loop  \\ncondition becomes false then break statement is used. Break statement is used  \\ninside loop and switch statements. It cause immediate exit from that loop in which  \\nit appears and it is generally written with condition. It is written with the keyword  \\nas break. When break statement is encountered loop is terminated and control is  \\ntransferred to the statement, immediately after loop or situation where we want to  \\njump out of the loop instantly without waiting to get back to conditional state.\\nWhen break is encountered inside any loop, control automatically passes to the  \\nfirst statement after the loop.

Array of character is a string. Each data item of an  \\narray is called an element. And each element is unique and located in separated  \\nmemory location.  Each of elements of an array share a variable but each element  \\nhaving different index no. known as subscript. \\nAn array can be a single dimensional or multi-dimensional and number  of  \\nsubscripts determines its dimension. And number of subscript is always starts with  \\nzero. One dimensional array is known as vector and two dimensional arrays are  \\nknown as matrix. \\nADVANTAGES : array variable can store more than one value at a time where  \\nother variable can store one value at a time.\\nExample:\\n       int  arr[100];\\n                                                                                   45                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                              int mark[100];\\n   DECLARATION OF AN ARRAY :\\n     Its syntax is :\\n    Data type array name [size];\\n              int arr[100];\\n                                  int mark[100];\\nint a[5]={10,20,30,100,5}\\nThe declaration of an array tells the compiler that, the data type, name of the array,  \\nsize of the array and for each element it occupies memory space.

The outer for loop  \\ncorresponds to the row and the inner for loop corresponds to the column.\\nFor example\\nint a[4][5];\\nfor reading value:-\\n                                                                                   53                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        for(i=0;i<4;i++)\\n{\\nfor(j=0;j<5;j++)\\n{\\nscanf(“%d”,&a[i][j]);\\n}\\n}\\nFor displaying value:-\\nfor(i=0;i<4;i++)\\n{\\nfor(j=0;j<5;j++)\\n{\\nprintf(“%d”,a[i][j]);\\n}\\n}\\nInitialization of 2-d array:\\n2-D array can be initialized in a way similar to that of 1-D array. for example:-\\nint mat[4][3]={11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22};\\nThese values are assigned to the elements row wise, so the values of  \\nelements after this initialization are\\nMat[0][0]=11, Mat[1][0]=14, Mat[2][0]=17  Mat[3][0]=20\\nMat[0][1]=12,   Mat[1][1]=15, Mat[2][1]=18  Mat[3][1]=21\\nMat[0][2]=13, Mat[1][2]=16, Mat[2][2]=19 Mat[3][2]=22\\n                                                                                   54                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        While initializing we can group the elements row wise using inner braces.\\nfor example:-\\n    int mat[4][3]={{11,12,13},{14,15,16},{17,18,19},{20,21,22}};\\nAnd while initializing , it is necessary to mention the 2nd dimension where 1st \\ndimension is optional.\\nint mat[][3];\\nint mat[2][3];\\nint mat[][];\\nint mat[2][];  invalid\\nIf we initialize an array  as \\n    int mat[4][3]={{11},{12,13},{14,15,16},{17}};\\nThen the compiler will assume its all rest value as 0,which are not defined.\\nMat[0][0]=11, Mat[1][0]=12, Mat[2][0]=14, Mat[3][0]=17\\nMat[0][1]=0, Mat[1][1]=13, Mat[2][1]=15 Mat[3][1]=0\\nMat[0][2]=0, Mat[1][2]=0, Mat[2][2]=16, Mat[3][2]=0\\nIn memory map whether it is 1-D or 2-D, elements are stored in one  \\ncontiguous manner.\\nWe can also give the size of the 2-D array by using symbolic constant\\nSuch as\\n                         #define ROW 2;\\n                                                                                   55                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                                      #define COLUMN 3;\\n             int mat[ROW][COLUMN];\\nString\\nArray of character is called a string. It is always terminated by the NULL  \\ncharacter. String is a one dimensional array of character. \\nWe can initialize the string as\\nchar name[]={‘j’,’o’,’h’,’n’,’\\\\o’};\\nHere each character occupies 1 byte of memory and last character is always NULL  \\ncharacter.  Where ’\\\\o’ and 0 (zero) are not same, where ASCII value of ‘\\\\o’ is 0  \\nand ASCII value of 0 is 48. Array elements of character array are also stored in  \\ncontiguous memory allocation.\\nFrom the above we can represent as;\\n    J     o     h      N  ‘\\\\o’\\n The terminating NULL is important because it is only the way that the  \\nfunction that work with string can know, where string end.\\nString can also be initialized as;\\nchar name[]=”John”;\\nHere the NULL character is not necessary and the compiler will assume it  \\nautomatically. \\nString constant (string literal)\\n                                                                                   56                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        A string constant is a set of character that enclosed within the double quotes  \\nand is also called a literal. Whenever a string constant is written anywhere in a  \\nprogram it is stored somewhere in a memory as an array of characters terminated  \\nby a NULL character (‘\\\\o’).\\nExample – “m”\\n     “Tajmahal”\\n     “My age is %d and height is %f\\\\n”\\nThe string constant itself becomes a pointer to the first character in array.\\nExample-char crr[20]=”Taj mahal”;\\n \\n   It is called base address.\\n          \\n                             Lecture Note: 13\\nString library function\\nThere are several string library functions used to manipulate string and the  \\nprototypes for these functions are in header file “string.h”. Several string functions  \\nare\\nstrlen()\\nThis function return the length of the string. i.e. the number of characters in the  \\nstring excluding the terminating NULL character.\\nIt accepts a single argument which is pointer to the first character of the string.\\n                                                                                   57                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        100010011002100310041005100610071001009\\n  T   a   j   M   A    H   a   l  \\\\oFor example-\\nstrlen(“suresh”);\\nIt return the value 6.\\nIn array version to calculate legnth: -\\nint str(char str[])\\n{\\nint i=0;\\nwhile(str[i]!=’\\\\o’)\\n{\\ni++;\\n}\\nreturn i;\\n}\\nExample:-\\n#include<stdio.h>\\n #include<string.h>\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nchar str[50];\\nprint(”Enter a string:”);\\n                                                                                   58                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        gets(str);\\nprintf(“Length of the string is %d\\\\n”,strlen(str));\\n}\\nOutput:\\nEnter a string: C in Depth\\nLength of the string is 8\\nstrcmp()\\nThis function is used to compare two strings.

The compiler execute these functions when the semicolon is followed by the  \\nfunction name.\\nExample:-        \\n  function(arg1,arg2,arg3);\\nThe argument that are used inside the function call are called actual argument\\nEx:-\\n   int S=sum(a, b);                        //actual arguments\\nActual argument\\nThe arguments which are mentioned or used inside the function call is knows as  \\nactual argument and these are the original values and copy of these are actually  \\nsent to the called function\\nIt can be written as constant, expression or any function call like\\n                         Function (x);\\n                          Function (20, 30);\\n                         Function (a*b, c*d);\\n                         Function(2,3,sum(a, b));\\nFormal Arguments\\nThe arguments which are mentioned in function definition are called formal  \\narguments or dummy arguments.\\n                                                                                   66                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        These arguments are used to just hold the copied of the values that are sent by the  \\ncalling function through the function call.\\nThese arguments are like other local variables which are created when the function  \\ncall starts and destroyed when the function ends.\\nThe basic difference between the formal argument and the actual argument are\\n                  1) The formal argument are declared inside the parenthesis where as the  \\nlocal variable declared at the beginning of the function block.\\n2). The formal argument  are automatically initialized when the copy of actual  \\narguments are passed while other local variable are assigned values through the  \\nstatements.\\nOrder number and type of actual arguments in the function call should be match  \\nwith the order number and type of the formal arguments.\\nReturn type\\nIt is used to return value to the calling function. It can be used in two way as\\n                      return\\n          Or       return(expression);\\n           Ex:-     return (a);\\n                      return (a*b);\\n                     return (a*b+c);\\nHere the 1st return statement used to terminate the function without returning any  \\nvalue\\nEx:-   /*summation of two values*/\\n        int sum (int a1, int a2);\\n       main()\\n                                                                                   67                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                              {\\n         int a,b;\\n          printf(“enter two no”);\\n          scanf(“%d%d”,&a,&b);\\n           int S=sum(a,b);\\n           printf(“summation is = %d”,s);\\n            }\\n           int sum(intx1,int y1)\\n            {\\n          int z=x1+y1;\\n           Return z;\\n           }\\nAdvantage of function\\nBy using function large and difficult program can be divided in to sub programs  \\nand solved. When we want to perform some task repeatedly or some code is to be  \\nused more than once at different place in the program, then function avoids this  \\nrepeatition or rewritten over and over.\\nDue to reducing size, modular function it is easy to modify and test\\nNotes:-\\nC program is a collection of one or more function.\\nA function is get called when function is followed by the semicolon.\\nA function is defined when a function name followed by a pair of curly braces\\n                                                                                   68                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Any function can be called by another function even main() can be called by other  \\nfunction.\\nmain()\\n{\\nfunction1()\\n}\\nfunction1()\\n{\\nStatement;\\nfunction2;\\n}\\nfunction 2()\\n{\\n}\\nSo every function in a program must be called directly or indirectly by the main()  \\nfunction. A function can be called any number of times. \\nA function can call itself again and again and this process is called recursion.\\nA function can be called from other function but a function can’t be defined in  \\nanother function \\n                                        Lecture Note: 15\\n               Category of Function based on argument and return type\\n              i) Function with no argument & no return value\\n                                                                                   69                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                                             Function that have no argument and no return value is written as:-\\n                void  function(void);\\n              main()\\n               {\\n             void  function()\\n              {\\n            Statement;\\n              } \\n      Example:-      \\n          void  me();\\n              main()\\n            {\\n               me();\\n              printf(“in  main”);\\n             }\\n             void   me()\\n           {\\n               printf(“come  on”);\\n           }\\nOutput: come on\\n             inn main\\n                                                                                   70                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        ii) Function with no argument but return value\\n            Syntax:-\\n              int   fun(void);\\n              main()\\n             {\\n                  int  r;\\n                  r=fun();\\n               }\\n                  int   fun()\\n                {\\n                reurn(exp);\\n                }\\n          Example:-\\n             int   sum();\\n            main()\\n            {\\n            int   b=sum();\\n            printf(“entered   %d\\\\n, b”);\\n             }\\n           int   sum()\\n              {\\n            int  a,b,s;\\n                                                                                   71                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                                     s=a+b;\\n            return  s;\\n                }\\nHere called function is independent and are initialized.

If  \\nits variable is not initialized, then it is automatically initialized to zero.\\nExample:\\nvoid fun1(void);\\nvoid fun2(void);\\nvoid main()\\n{\\nfun1();\\nfun2();\\n}\\nvoid fun1()\\n{\\n                                                                                   79                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        int a=10, static int b=2;\\nprintf(“a=%d, b=%d”,a,b);\\na++;\\nb++;\\n}          \\n      Output:a= 10  b=  2\\n                     a=10   b= 3       \\n               Recursion\\n          When function calls itself (inside function body) again and again then it is  \\ncalled as recursive function. In recursion calling function and called function are  \\nsame. It is powerful technique of writing complicated algorithm in easiest way.  \\nAccording to recursion problem is defined in term of itself. Here statement with in  \\nbody of the function calls the same function and same times it is called as circular  \\ndefinition. In other words recursion is the process of defining something in form of  \\nitself.\\n    Syntax:\\nmain ()\\n{\\nrec(); /*function call*/\\nrec(); \\nrec();\\nEx:-/*calculate factorial of a no.using recursion*/\\nint fact(int);\\nvoid main()\\n                                                                                   80                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        {\\nint num;\\nprintf(“enter a number”);\\nscanf(“%d”,&num);\\nf=fact(num);\\nprintf(“factorial is =%d\\\\n”f);\\n}\\nfact (int num)\\n{\\nIf  (num==0||num==1)\\nreturn 1;\\nelse\\nreturn(num*fact(num-1));\\n}\\n            Lecture Note: 18\\nMonolithic Programming \\nThe program which contains a single function for the large program is called  \\nmonolithic program.  In monolithic program not divided the program, it is  huge  \\nlong pieces of code that jump back and forth doing all the tasks  like single thread  \\nof execution, the program requires. Problem arise in monolithic program is that,  \\nwhen the program  size increases it leads inconvenience and difficult to maintain  \\n                                                                                   81                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        such as testing, debugging etc. Many disadvantages of monolithic programming  \\nare:\\n            1. Difficult to check error on large programs size. \\n             2. Difficult to maintain because of huge size. \\n          3. Code can be specific to a particular problem. i.e. it cannot be reused. \\n  Many early languages (FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, C) required one huge  \\nworkspace with labelled areas that may does specific tasks but are not isolated.  \\nModular Programming  \\nThe process of subdividing a computer program into separate sub-programs such  \\nas functions and subroutines is called Modular programming. Modular \\nprogramming sometimes also called as structured programming. It \\nenables multiple programmers to divide up the large program and debug  \\npieces of program independently and tested.\\n. Then the linker will  link all these modules to form the complete program.  This \\nprinciple dividing  software up into parts, or modules, where a module can be  \\nchanged, replaced, or removed, with minimal effect on the other software it works  \\nwith. Segmenting the program into modules clearly defined functions,  it can  \\ndetermine the source of program errors more easily. Breaking down program  \\nfunctions into modules, where each of which accomplishes one function and  \\ncontains all the source code and variables needed to accomplish that function.  \\nModular program is the solution to the problem of very large program that are  \\ndifficult to debug, test and maintain. A program module may be rewritten while its  \\ninputs and outputs remain the same. The person making a change may only  \\nunderstand a small portion of the original program.  \\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is compatible with the modular programming  \\nconcept to a large extent. \\n.   ,        Less code has to be written that makes shorter.\\n                                                                                   82                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        •A single procedure can be developed for reuse, eliminating the need to  \\nretype the code many times.\\n•Programs can be designed more easily because a small team deals with only  \\na small part of the entire code.\\n•Modular programming allows many programmers to collaborate on the same  \\napplication.\\n•The code is stored across multiple files.\\n•Code is short, simple and easy to understand and modify, make simple to  \\nfigure out how the program is operate and reduce likely hood of bugs.\\n•Errors can easily be identified, as they are localized to a subroutine or  \\nfunction or isolated to specific module.\\n•The same code can be reused in many applications.\\n•The scoping of variables and functions can easily be controlled.\\nDisadvantages \\nHowever it may takes longer to develop the program using this technique.  \\nStorage Classes\\nStorage class in c language is a specifier which tells the compiler where and how to  \\nstore variables, its initial value and   scope of  the variables in a program. Or  \\nattributes of variable is known as storage class or in compiler point of view a  \\nvariable identify some physical location within a computer where its string of bits  \\nvalue can be stored is known as storage class.\\nThe kind of location in the computer, where value can be stored is either in the  \\nmemory or in the register. There are various storage class which determined, in  \\nwhich of the two location value would be stored.\\nSyntax of declaring storage classes is:-\\n                     storageclass     datatype    variable name;\\nThere are four types of storage classes and all are keywords:-\\n1 )  Automatic (auto)\\n                                                                                   83                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        2 )  Register (register)\\n3)  Static (static)\\n4 ) External (extern)\\n              Examples:-  \\n                             auto float x; or float x;\\n                                   extern int x;\\n                                   register char c;\\n                                   static int y;\\nCompiler assume different storage class based on:- \\n1 ) Storage class:-  tells us about storage place(where variable would be stored).\\n2)  Intial value :- what would be the initial value of the variable.\\nIf initial value not assigned, then what value taken by uninitialized variable.\\n 3)  Scope of the variable:- what would be the value of the variable of the program.\\n   4)  Life time :- It is the time between the creation and distribution of a variable  \\nor how long would variable exists.\\n  \\n1. Automatic storage class\\nThe keyword used to declare automatic storage class is auto.\\nIts features:-\\nStorage-memory location\\nDefault initial value :-unpredictable value or garbage value.\\n                                                                                   84                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Scope:-local to the block or function in which variable is defined.\\nLife time:-Till the control remains within function or block in which it is defined.  \\nIt terminates when function is released.  \\nThe variable without any storage class specifier is called automatic variable. \\nExample:-\\nmain( )\\n{\\nauto int i;\\nprintf(“i=”,i);\\n}\\n            Lecture Note: 19\\n                2. Register storage class\\nThe keyword used to declare this storage class is register.\\nThe features are:-\\nStorage:-CPU register.\\nDefault initial value  :-garbage value\\nScope :-local to the function or block in which it is defined.\\nLife time :-till controls remains within function or blocks in which it is defined.\\nRegister variable don’t have memory address so we can’t apply address operator  \\non it. CPU register generally of 16 bits or 2 bytes. So we can apply storage classes  \\nonly for integers, characters, pointer type.\\n                                                                                   85                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Variable stored in register storage class always access faster than,which is always  \\nstored in the memory. But to store all variable in the CPU register is not possible  \\nbecause of limitation of the register pair.\\nAnd when variable is used at many places like loop counter, then it is better to  \\ndeclare it as register class.\\nExample:-\\nmain( )\\n{\\nregister int i;\\nfor(i=1;i<=12;i++)\\nprintf(“%d”,i);\\n}\\n  \\n 3 Static storage class\\nThe keyword used to declare static storage class is static.\\nIts feature are:-\\nStorage:-memory location\\nDefault initial value :- zero \\nScope :- local to the block or function in which it is defined.\\nLife time:- value of the variable persist or remain between different function call.\\nExample:-\\nmain( )\\n                                                                                   86                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        {\\nreduce( );\\nreduce( );\\nreduce ( );\\n}\\nreduce( )\\n{\\nstatic int x=10;\\nprintf(“%d”,x);\\nx++;\\n}\\nOutput:-10,11,12            \\nExternal storage classes\\nThe keyword used for this class is extern.\\nFeatures are:-\\nStorage:- memory area\\nDefault initial value:- zero\\nScope :- global \\nLife time:-as long as program execution remains it retains.\\n                                                                                   87                                                                  *Under revision\\n                                                                        Declaration does not create variables, only it refer that already been created at  \\nsomewhere else.
